## About the Project

The Shopping List CLI is a command-line application that allows users to:

- Add multiple items to a shopping list with quantity tracking
- Remove items from the shopping list
- Update the quantity of an existing item
- View all items and quantities currently listed
- Handle and validate user input gracefully through a dedicated input handling function
- Navigate the menu using a dictionary structure that maps user choices directly to functions, improving code clarity and organization
- Structure the code using modular functions, with parameters and return values
- Follow professional clean coding practices and documentation standards
